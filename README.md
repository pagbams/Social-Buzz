### **Data Sources**

Sales data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is a "content and reaction csv" file, containg detailed information about each viewed contents and their category

The client sent through:

- 7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values
- A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.
